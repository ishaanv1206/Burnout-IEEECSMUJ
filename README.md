# üèçÔ∏è MotoGP Lap Time Prediction using AutoML

This project leverages **FLAML's AutoML framework** to build a high-performance regression model for predicting **MotoGP lap times** using rich race data. The core ML engine is a tuned **LightGBM Regressor**, automatically optimized through FLAML.

---

## üìä Problem Statement

Given historical MotoGP data ‚Äî including rider info, bike and team details, environmental conditions, tire specifications, and race statistics ‚Äî the objective is to accurately **predict average lap time in seconds** (`Lap_Time_Seconds`).
